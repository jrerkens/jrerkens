- Hi, Iâ€™m @jrerkens !
- My name is Jimmy Erkens and I'm currently an undergraduate Statistics and Anthropology student at The Ohio State University.
- Regarding my professional goals, I intend to pursue a PhD program in biological anthropology while continuing to improve and implement my skills in data analysis.
- Within bioanth, I'm primarily interested in stress and craniofacial morphology of non-human primates. 
- My statistics education at Ohio State has generally been rooted in frequency based mathematical statistics; however, I've begun shifting my focus more toward Bayesian methodologies in my work.
- I'm currently working on my thesis work regarding fluctuating facial asymmetry in populations of colobus monkeys. I'm using `geomorph` to conduct a frequency-based 3D Procrustes analysis and I'll be using `brms` for further Bayesian results.
- On github I post my open-source datasets as well as code from my data analyses, check @jrerkens on sketchfab for a repository of my 3D models.
- Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions !
